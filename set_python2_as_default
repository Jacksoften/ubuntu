```
alias python = "/usr/bin/python2.7"
```

# This method will not work after restarting terminal, Not a Good method.

# update method
put "alias python=python2" or "alias python = "/usr/bin/python2.7" into ~/.bash_profile



# update method
```{bash}
vim ~/.bash_profile
```
Mine shows as
```
# Setting PATH for Python 2.7
# The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH

# added by Anaconda2 5.0.1 installer
export PATH="/Users/yunzheli/anaconda2/bin:$PATH"

# added by Anaconda3 5.0.1 installer
export PATH="/Users/yunzheli/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

```

I notice the path of anaconda3 is exported later than the path of anaconda2
Now, swich path of anaconda2 and path of anaconda3
```
# Setting PATH for Python 2.7
# The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH

# added by Anaconda3 5.0.1 installer
export PATH="/Users/yunzheli/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"

# added by Anaconda2 5.0.1 installer
export PATH="/Users/yunzheli/anaconda2/bin:$PATH"

```
It should work
